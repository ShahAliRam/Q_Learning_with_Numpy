# Q_Learning_with_Numpy
In this code, I am using the Q Learning Algorithm to solve a Maze Problem. The following numbers are used to represent the grid world:

+1 is used for the AGENT.
+10 is used for the GOAL.
-10 is used for the KILLER TRAP.
-1 is used for SMALL TRAP.
+2 is used for SMALL REWARDS.
0 is used for EMPTY SPACE.

The AGENT, GOAL, KILLER TRAP, SMALL TRAPS, and SMALL REWARDS are all placed randomly in the grid. 
The main objective of this code is not to find the optimal actions, instead I just want to implement simple Q-Learning Algorithm from Scratch.
